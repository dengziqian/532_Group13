<p>data science is about analyzing relevant data to obtain patterns of information in order to help achieve a goal. the main focus of the data analysis is the goal rather then the methodology on how it will achieved. this allows for creative thinking and allowing for the optimal solution or model to be found wihtout the constraint of a specific methodology.</p>
"<p>at it's fundamental core, i believe that data science is ultimately a way to allow people and businesses to compound and work with their observations (essentially, that's what data is--- a recorded observation) and gain as much of an understanding of their context and problems as they possibly can, and use information they can generate to make deeper insights, greater decisions, and ultimately, shift paradigms and propel humanity forward.聽</p>
<p>as mentioned in the lecture, ultimately what this data will be used for is solving humanities problems more efficiently than ever before.聽</p>
<p>with the greater power this increase in data gives humanity though comes an increased responsibility---- just as easily as bigger data can help, in the case of people who are underinformed in data science techniques and aren't aware that they may not be using suitable practices, the additional data and sophisticated techniques will just allow a poor practitioner to get themselves and others in trouble faster than before, and at greater magnitudes.<br><br>ultimately, however, i think this increase of data and the development of computing tools and methodologies to help process it faster and better will be one of the biggest benefits humanity has seen yet--- it may take a few years to get there, but this is truly an exciting time to be involved in data science.聽</p>

"<p>having worked in technology, particularly on the web building websites, running large scale websites and managing engineers, i have found data science to be some of what we did before it had a name.聽</p>
<p>when i was the gm at a daily newspaper we had millions of users each month looking at 30+ million pages a month. in general you can get lost in the data and what is actionable. but we focused on the actions we could take. that got us into analytics like omniture. but it wasn't enough. we started doing a/b testing but with a focus on actions. then we would get lost in the content users wanted to and building models around that. then we grew into trying to machine learn about users on the fly, store info, make suggestions and build emails around modeling. ever since then i've been hooked on data because it doesn't lie. yes, you might find many red herrings but ultimately you can find concrete actionable information within the data that doesn't mislead you like opinions.聽</p>
<p>i still work online but more in an agency setting but also with publications. agriculture is our niche and this is an industry that is growing massively in big data from farming/planting to weather. the goal is making farming far more predictible.聽</p>"
"<p>i work as a financial analyst and as a result i have to sift through a lot of data to be able to make decisions and advice management. ordinarily, the stock market is full of so much information which requires good understanding before you anyone can invest hard earned money. i believe this is where data science comes handy. data science is therefore a science of eliminating unwanted data (noise) and using good data to make accurate decisions or conclusions about the future.</p>"
"<p>data science is the science of using data in order to provide the means to answers questions using large amounts of data in the most efficient and correct way possible. 聽i think an important distinction here is that in true data science you aren't just giving the answer, you are providing a way to answer questions and maybe even bring up new questions. 聽in my current role, i know i am not using data scientist techniques. 聽i find myself being asked specific questions like &quot;how many contacts did we get from canada last year&quot;. 聽they don't want a dashboard, they don't want a streamlined process that would allow them to answer this same question on another country. 聽a data scientist would set up the data so that these questions could be asked later in a different and efficient way. 聽a data scientist may even start by asking 聽&quot;what are we really solving? 聽do we really gain insight by knowing the number of contacts from canada? 聽or is there a deeper issue we are trying to solve. 聽perhaps what is behind a perceived increase in contacts in canada?&quot;. 聽聽</p>"
"<p>in my opinion data science in lamen terms has to do with 'trying to make sense of it all'. there is so much data available these days that it is difficult to make good use of this data so that organizations can make better decisions. but the beneficiaries are individual users as well, such as with applications in the health space. the advent of new repository technologies has expanded the scope of how we can implement and use data, so knowledge of now these new technologies work is important in order to apply data science initiatives effectively.聽</p>"
"<p>data science in my understanding is a process of extracting knowledge from any data to help in obtaining wisdom through the knowledge gained and ultimately solve any challenges/improve upon anything we do.<br><br>with so much overexplosion of data in the systems, it is just natural that the evolution of data science has taken place.聽 as it goes by the famous saying &quot;in god we trust, all others bring data&quot;, the insights gained through data would be highly valued/irrefutable in today's complex business environment.聽 data science in my opinion will not be limited to statistics, machine learning, software techniques, understanding business to which it is applied to, but will soon evolve to complex study using the strengths of other areas of science.</p>"

"<p>from what i have heard / read so far on data science, it seems very similar to archaeology. 聽digging and sifting through countless amounts of data trying to find something out of it all. 聽whether it be a few gems like key points of data when used in a science setting or finding relationships between the different &quot;dig sites&quot; to find patterns in it all. 聽the difference being though in actual archaeology, we only have 1 earth with 1 history to dig through, where as in the computer world, we practically have a new history (data set) generated on a new planet (company / organization) every single day. 聽it is up to the data scientist to find efficient ways to dig through these ever increasing piles of sand before we eventually become buried in it.</p>"
"<p>hi,</p>
<p>with vast amounts of data now available, companies in almost every industry are focused on exploiting data for competitive advantage. data science is where you make use of a large amout of data in order to make better dicision, solve business problems, building data products, and design data model. according to drewconway, data science is a combination of hacking skills, math &amp; statistics knowledge, and substantive expertise.</p>

"<p>i do not have any experience in the field so it is hard to come up with my own definition of data science. however based on the video by josh wills and the other responses by the students it seems that data science is the study of utilizing data to form a substantive model. another student, violeta, noted that data scientists focus more on utilizing all the data available to them and do not spend a lot of time on forming ways to collect the data. i thought this was interesting but i think as we enter the field it may be important to take a different mental approach than this. while a data scientist may spend more time analyzing and cleaning data sets as josh noted they should also have a solid understanding of the ways in which the data was collect because this will improve results in the future. by doing so we can provide feedback to those who are developing tools to collect data and help them shape their systems to provide more useful data sets.</p>
<p>a simple analogy that comes to mind is lego builders verse lego designers. a data scientist is similar to a child playing with a large box of assorted legos and piecing together different parts to create something new. once the child has experience building a different sort of creations they may be able to design a simple lego that will allow them to greatly increase the number of designs they can build. the child doesn't have to know how the pieces are made or the type of plastic that is used but can still provide feedback on pieces to be designed in the future that would be useful to them as a builder.</p>"

"<p>data science, in my words is science using which 'relevant' data can be extracted from a superset of data. data can be huge and finding the relevant data that will answer the question that we are trying to answer can be cumbersome. data science helps in extracting that answer by using domain knowledge, if any, computational skills and statistical science to get to a statistically significant confidence level for that answer. this seems part science and part art. the science part involves collecting and computing the data. the art part involves analyzing that data to come up with a correct answer. overall, the gist of data science is to find statistically signifant answer to the problem we are trying to solve.聽</p>"
"<p>i'm very new to the concept of data science. based on the readings i've completed and the videos we've just seen, i have a few thoughts. since it's in the title, data obviously plays an important role. a somewhat circular definition of data seems to be: information that is organized in a significant way to the person(s) accessing it, often in electronic format.聽any science is usually the ability to explain, understand, and predict.</p>
<p>it sounds like exactly what josh willis was describing: data science may be described as the ability to explain, understand, and predict information that is organized in a significant way to the person(s) accessing it.</p>
<p>the most interesting thing that i found from the videos is that data science is often done on &quot;unpredictable&quot; sets of data, be it聽economic, psychological, or otherwise. i bet this makes model creation (the ability to predict) pretty difficult!聽</p>"
"<p>from the first video with josh wills, data science is a huge field that involves software programming and mathemtical analyses to process and find useful trends in data for businesses and industries. from the second video about cheeseburgers, data science can be a neat tool to give insight about the digital world around us. it seems that data science is a field that inevitably arose from a digital age where most information is recorded and from the need to mine the data for facts/trends/correlations for profit/consumer-exploitation/knowledge.</p>"

"<p>i am new to data science and all i can figure out a definition for this is that, data science is all about analyzing the existing data/information and finding out an efficient solution with creativity to achieve the ultimate goal. 聽</p>"
"<p>in my opinion, data science is a general term for extracting knowledge from a given dataset. a data scientist is similar to a research scientist where extensive analyses are performed on the data collected with the hope of drawing meaningful conclusions that would contribute to the field of study. it is often common to use statistics and data processing software in science-related research, but it is not a requirement in some fields such as theoretical physics where formulated models are not as data-driven. on the other hand, the use of statistics and data analysis tools appears to be a must for the field of data science, as it attempts to validate hypotheses through empirical data.</p>
<p>in addition, as data becomes more and more abundant and easily accessible, data science can be applied to social studies, business decisions making, or almost in any fields of studies.</p>
